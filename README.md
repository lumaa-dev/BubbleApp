# [Threaded](https://apps.lumaa.fr/app/threaded)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The app is currently being tested on TestFlight and will be hitting the App Store later this year.

[Threaded](https://apps.lumaa.fr/app/threaded) is a very simple [#Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) client, that is meant to look like the newest social media [#Threads](https://threads.net/) made by Meta Platforms. It integrates perfectly with your Mastodon account, and matches the Threads vibe, while having Mastodon-only features.

Threaded is free, made in SwiftUI, [#OpenSource](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/ThreadedApp), and doesn't violate [#YourPrivacy](https://apps.lumaa.fr/legal/privacy). Follow the [#ThreadedAccount](https://mastodon.online/@Threaded) on Mastodon, for progress, updates, polls, and more...

Threaded **will** also includes its own premium service, available as a subscription and lifetime payment, called Threaded+ (or Plus for short). Plus only adds additional features to Threaded, you don't need a subscription to like, post, bookmark, or use any primary Mastodon feature. Currently, all available Threaded+ features are free, until further notice.

With Threaded+, you can have a better Content Filter, you can save attachments, you get exclusive sneak peeks to Threaded's next updates, and other premium features!
